# Biography

I'm Ph.D student in [Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality](http://campar.in.tum.de/WebHome), [Fakultät für Informatik](http://www.in.tum.de) in [Technische Universität München](https://www.tum.de/) for computer vision and machine learning. 

Currently co-supervised by Dr. [Federico Tombari](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/FedericoTombari) and Prof. Dr. [Nassir Navab](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavab). with a topic of *Development of deep learning techniques for representation and processing of 3D data for complex visual tasks*.

I get master degree in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Laboratory from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://www.bupt.edu.cn/), supervised by Dr. [Weihong Deng](http://www.whdeng.cn/). Two years are spent on research for biomedical information analysis and 3D vision tasks in BUPT. Additionally, I'm also track and field athlete in rank B League of Beijing City. 

Several academic projects were sponsored by Microsoft and Google open source funding, two Google Summer of Codes projects are supervised by mentors in OpenCV which is [tiny-dnn](https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn) and [3D object pose estimation](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/cnn_3dobj).
