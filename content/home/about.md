# Biography

I am Ph.D student of [Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality](http://campar.in.tum.de/WebHome), [Fakultät für Informatik](http://www.in.tum.de) in [Technische Universität München](https://www.tum.de/). Currently co-supervised by Dr. [Federico Tombari](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/FedericoTombari) and Prof. Dr. [Nassir Navab](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavab). My topic is development of deep learning techniques for representation and processing of 3D data for complex visual tasks.

Previously I got master degree in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System Laboratory from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://www.bupt.edu.cn/), supervised by Dr. [Weihong Deng](http://www.whdeng.cn/). I spent two years doing research on biometic information analysis and 3D vision tasks.

Several academic projects are ever sponsored by Microsoft and Google open source funding, two Google Summer of Codes projects are supervised by mentors in OpenCV which is [tiny-dnn](https://github.com/tiny-dnn/tiny-dnn) and [3D object pose estimation](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/cnn_3dobj).
