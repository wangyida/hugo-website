abstract = "This work is mainly based on CNTK from Microsoft Re- search. It includes both utilization on hardware and software. I make it possible doing classification and pose estimation on 3D models and pre- diction on real images. I turn work of 3D model utilization and real photo recognition based on CNN using Caffe into a complete framework includ- ing 3D model rendering, CNN training and object recognition based on CNTK and other open source tool kits such OpenCV, VTK, OpenMP, OpenBlas and Blender. I also make CNTK available on Mac for object recognition based on 3D object or normal photos."
