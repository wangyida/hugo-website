Here is the original blog of [Microsoft research for open source challenge](Microsoft Research Blog).

The Open Source Challenge did exactly what we’d hoped: the winning students — some of whom hadn’t known about the offerings available through the Open Source for Academics program at Microsoft—found the tools they needed to solve real problems. Their takeaway from the experience—in addition to the prizes and, we hope, the greatly-deserved awe of their colleagues—is that they have a new source for tools to help them with future projects, solving future problems. Others—many of whom were already using Microsoft Research open source—seized the opportunity to put their work in front of the people who appreciate it most.

At the same time, the Challenge has opened up to Microsoft’s researchers a new wave of developers who can engage and assist in taking their tools forward. Open source is far from just a mechanism for releasing code; it’s a means for building a community of users who are also developers and who care about the direction and quality of the product, whether large or small. With their fresh approach, students can play a key role in creating these communities and helping direct the products Microsoft cares about. An example is the project submitted by Yida Wang, who adapted the CNTK platform for the Mac. Yida submitted a change from a dependency on one open source library to another that was compatible with the Mac. Yida’s work involves looking at synthetic images and real photos, and he needs parallelization to achieve reasonable run times.  His project filled his particular need, and  this expanded capability is now available to all.

Software development advances and experimentation continue to be pushed by the no-strings-attached, ready availability of code and software that open source provides. We hope that opportunities like the Open Source Challenge will continue to stimulate innovation and creative research approaches by connecting students and other innovators with code and data that’s been grown in our own labs.
